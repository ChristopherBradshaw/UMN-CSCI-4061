Assignment 2 - Image conversion w/ child processes

Usage: ./parallel_convert (convert_count) (output_dir) (input_dir)

A makefile is provided:
	make - build executable
	make clean - remove executable

converted JPGS, HTML files and log files into the output directory.

The use of synchronization methods such as mutexes/locks are not attempted
because they have not been covered in class yet.
