Usage:
	create_images.sh <input_directory> <output_directory> <pattern_1> [pattern_2] ... [pattern_n]

Example: 
	./create_images.sh input_directory output_directory "*.png" "*.tiff" "*.gif"

Arguments: 
	- input_directory
		(required) Specifies directory for input.

	- output_directory
		(required) Specifies directory for output.
		
	- patterns:
		Regular expression searching for .png, .tiff, and .gif are 
		valid arguements. At least one pattern must be provided.

What script does:
	Given an input directory containing images and specified
	patterns (png, gif, tiff are the only supported file types), images matching the patterns will be 
	converted to .jpg format. Each converted image will produce a thumbnail and
	will be placed with other thumbnails in a folder. An HTML file is created that
	allows the files to be viewed from a web browser.


How it works:
	Command line argument requirements are first enforced. If an invalid number of arguments is present
	or a non-existant/non-readable input directory is specified, the program will terminate. Otherwise,
	the script will recursively find all files within the input directory matching the patterns and generate
	new .jpg files (one with the same dimensions and one thumbnail). Once every image has been processed, 
	the user is prompted with a "theme". At the end of all processing, an HTML file is generated displaying 
	the newly converted pictures and their respective dates, dimensions, etc. The HTML file also includes 
	the current date as well as the theme just entered.

Output Interpretation:
	Status of the program is output at appropriate times throughout execution of the program. At a minimum,
	a start message and end message are generated.
