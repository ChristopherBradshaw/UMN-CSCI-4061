Modifications from project specifications:
- Added UID, GID, and (max) filesize to Create_File

- Write_File takes in a count (number of bytes to write) 
    (otherwise, how would it know when to stop writing? 
    Image files have null characters all over the place)

Note: 
- Log files, summaries and HTML files are output in the working directory.
- Images (original & thumbnails) are placed in the specified output directory.
