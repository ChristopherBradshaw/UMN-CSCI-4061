Usage: ./mini_filesystem (input dir) (output dir) (log file)

Modifications from project specifications:
- Added UID, GID, and allocation filesize to Create_File

- Write_File takes in a count (number of bytes to write) 
    (otherwise, how would it know when to stop writing? 
    Image files have null characters all over the place)

- Offset is not included in Read/Write file. This is because this
    assignment makes absolutely no use of it and therefore just creates 
    unneccesary work. The assignment even says: "a file is contiguous 
    in this filesystem, you cannot write at any offset"

- A maximum filesize is provided at file creation, which is used to
    allocate blocks. This field is recorded in the inode struct 
    as "Allocated_Size". The actual filesize is still maintained. 
    The project assignment does not have any wording preventing this.

Note: 
- Log files, summaries and HTML files are output in the working directory.
- Images (original & thumbnails) are placed in the specified output directory.
